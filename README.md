### 📁 Data Collection

In this project, whether a person is wearing a mask or not mask as well as it will show the confidence value of the prediction. Also, this project has done up to 50000 epochs with error 0.08 values.Futher, 2200 images were collected among them 1000 images are without mask and 1200 images are with mask.

### 🔑 Prerequisites
* All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/KrishArul26/Live-Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Faster_rcnn/blob/main/requirements.txt)

### 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repo

* git clone https://github.com/KrishArul26/Live-Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Faster_rcnn.git

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo

* cd Live-Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Faster_rcnn

3. Create a Python 3.6 version of  virtual environment named 'mask' and activate it

* pip install virtualenv

* virtualenv mask

* mask\Scripts\activate

4. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required

* pip install -r requirements.txt

### 💡 Working

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory and type the following command:

* python face_mask_detection.py

### 🔑 Results 

* For this mask detection I have used computer vision trained net work which is faster-rcnn
